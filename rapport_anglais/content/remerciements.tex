I wish to thank David Ritchie and Bernard Maigret who trusted me to work on
this project and followed me throughout my internship.
  I would also like thank Olivier Devillers for his classes
  on the Delaunay triangulations and his explanations regarding the CGAL library.
   Finally, it is necessary for me to thank all the Capsid team for having facilitated my
    integration in the institute as well as all of the INRIA of Nancy.
